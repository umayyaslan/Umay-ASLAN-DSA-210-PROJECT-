DSA210 Project: Analysis of Earthquake Effects on Housing Sales in Selected Turkish Provinces

Overview
This project analyzes whether small-to-medium scale earthquakes cause significant changes in total housing sales in Balıkesir, Ankara, Istanbul, and Izmir—provinces representing different seismic risk profiles and economic characteristics.


Motivation
Turkey's diverse seismic landscape provides a natural laboratory for studying disaster economics. By examining these four specific provinces, we can compare how regional economic structures and seismic risk levels mediate the impact of earthquakes on housing markets.


Research Question
"Do small-to-medium scale destructive earthquakes significantly affect total housing sales in Balıkesir, Ankara, Istanbul, and Izmir?"
Hypothesis
"Small-to-medium scale destructive earthquakes do not significantly affect total housing sales in Balıkesir, Ankara, Istanbul, and Izmir at the aggregate level."


Selected Provinces Justification

Balıkesir
Seismic Profile: High-risk region with frequent small-to-medium scale earthquakes
Market Characteristics: Medium-sized provincial market, seasonal tourism influence
Rationale: Test hypothesis in frequently affected but economically resilient area

Ankara
Seismic Profile: Moderate risk with occasional small-scale seismic activity
Market Characteristics: Stable government-driven market, bureaucratic center
Rationale: Examine earthquake effects in a stable, inland market

Istanbul
Seismic Profile: High-risk megacity with periodic seismic activity
Market Characteristics: Turkey's largest and most dynamic housing market
Rationale: Test market resilience in high-stakes urban environment

Izmir
Seismic Profile: High-risk coastal region with significant historical earthquakes
Market Characteristics: Major port city with strong tourism and industrial base
Rationale: Analyze coastal metropolitan response patterns


Data Collection & Sources

Earthquake Data Parameters (AFAD)
Magnitude range: 4.0-6.0 Richter scale (small-to-medium scale)
Depth: 0-70 km
Time period: 2015-2023
Geographic coverage: Balıkesir, Ankara, Istanbul, Izmir provinces

Housing Sales Data (TÜİK)
Monthly housing sales by province (2015-2023)
Price per square meter trends
New vs existing building sales ratios
Mortgage and cash sales breakdown


Methodology

1. Province-Specific Analysis
Individual time-series analysis for each province
Province-specific seasonal adjustments
Control for local economic conditions

2. Comparative Framework
Cross-province DiD analysis: Treat affected province as treatment group, others as controls
Magnitude threshold analysis: Determine if effects vary by earthquake size across provinces
Recovery period comparison: Analyze how quickly markets return to normal in each province

3. Geospatial Analysis
Map earthquake epicenters relative to urban centers in each province
Calculate affected population percentages per event
Analyze distance-decay effects from epicenters
